# üêçPython Resources

üëã Hi,
This is my open sourced roadmap/resource guide for Python.
Please feel free to add resources or fix the broken links to make this repo more worthful.

## üíªInstallation 

Installation of Python is quite easy but here are some video guide to help you out.
There are actually 2 ways to use Python on your respective system one is [Python](https://www.python.org/) and other is Python through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (Recommended).
Installing both can create a mess (Presonal ExperinceüôÇ).

*I personally like to use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (Anaconda) for Python.*
